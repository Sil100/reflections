    -> What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When a reposiory is initialized a new file called .git is added into the directory where the 
    repository was created. From now on the git will track the changes of the files in that directory.

    A repository permits to have a centralized folder where the changes git metadatas related to a 
    given project are stored.


    -> How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value
       do you think it offers?

       Staging area is an intermediate space where you can add the files that you want to track. 
    In the future you can to commit the files you want or revert changes and don't commit some 
    modifications. You are free to commit only what you want.

       Into the working directory all the project's related files are present. Into the staging area
     are added only the current modified files. 

       I think that the working directory and the repository are the same. Off course, I can be wrong.
