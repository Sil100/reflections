    -> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
     I think is a good idea to use a remote repository when you want to:
       - colaborate with other people on a larger project
       - show your code to a possible employer or friend
       - need to access some files from different computers
       - distribute your code to a larger audience


    -> Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
       stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

      You need to be up to date before you push someting new to GitHub. This can help you to avoid
      conflicts.
      I am not sure what "Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository" means. Can
      git automatically pull from a remote repository?
