    -> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
     I think is a good idea to use a remote repository when you want to:
       - colaborate with other people on a larger project
       - show your code to a possible employer or friend
       - need to access some files from different computers
       - distribute your code to a larger audience
