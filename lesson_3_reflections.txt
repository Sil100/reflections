    -> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
     I think is a good idea to use a remote repository when you want to:
       - colaborate with other people on a larger project
       - show your code to a possible employer or friend
       - need to access some files from different computers
       - distribute your code to a larger audience


    -> Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
       stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

      You need to be up to date before you push someting new to GitHub. This can help you to avoid
      conflicts.
      I am not sure what "Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository" means. Can
      git automatically pull from a remote repository?



    -> Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
       instead of another?

       A fork is like a clone but it keep a reference to the original repository. A branch can starts 
       from either a clone or a fork. A fork is a copy of a repository of another user in our GitHub 
       space.


 
    -> What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

      If you have a copy of the last known stat of the remote stored locally you can modify that 
      copy and avoid conflicts that may appear if tha local copy is different than the remote copy.
